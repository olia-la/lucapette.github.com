I talk to people about hiring all the time. The reason is pretty obvious: we
need more people to do the things we want to do. More talent. It takes a
collective effort to ship 99% of things we build and that make hiring a
central problem when it comes about building, scaling, running a business. But
do not get me wrong: the actual reason why I am writing about hiring is not
the fact it is so central to the development of our teams and our businesses.
The actual reason is that despite is so central most people approach hiring in
a way that I barely understand.

There are so many things I do not understand about how we interview people,
how we write the ads we post on job boards, how we treat the candidates
that I have hard times to find a constructive way to talk about this. When I
get this feeling, I become more analytical. Analytical thoughts make me calm
again. So let's break the hiring process in parts and then we take it from
there:

- You need ads on job boards
- You have to screen people
- You have to interview them
- You have to either hire them or reject them

I may be simplifying this but at the end of the day, every breakdown is a bit
of a simplification of an actual process so I can live with that.

## Ads on job board

Are you a "jedi" JavaScript programmer? Or maybe a "warlord" backend
developer? A "kickass" application developer? Maybe you are more the classic
type: rockstar or ninja.

I am not sure why this happens. It is plain bullshit and it is stupid, sorry
for being so harsh about it. I have hard times to understand the reasons
behind this culture and to be honest I do not want to know anymore. I learned
to look at the bright side of this aspect of job ads. I avoid companies like
that.  It is a good side effect that I enjoy a lot.

Now, let's move on to the actual content of the ad. About the content itself
there are a couple of patterns I see all the time:

- buzzword, business talk with no actual meaning
- Very strict requirements to meet that are actually just non sense

The buzzwording mostly indicates people are lazy and let their HR people write
the ads for them: I know this is a strong assumption but, let's be honest, did
you ever care about "fast-growing company", "disrupting ideas", "uber for X"?
I guess you did not. And if you spend time writing your own ads most of this
crap will go away. I encourage you to write your own ads for another reason
too: it helps setting requirements that make sense. Some examples of non sense
requirements:

- X years of experience with our awesome stack

  This is really not inclusive. People tend not to believe me when I tell them
  I had to A/B test this in order to understand I was doing it wrong. My
  explanation is the following: most poeple I met in my career would read
  something like "5 years of experience with X" and say "well I read a blog
  post once about X so I guess I'm cool". That is fine, you would be able to
  figure this out while interviewing them anyway. But the actual problem here
  is that a lot of very cool candidates would read that and say "oh I have
  only 4.9 years of experience and that is a strict requirement so I won't
  apply". I generally use a different wording that means something very
  similar and it is more inclusive (in my opinion at least, I would love to
  hear yours on this topic). I write something along the lines of "proven
  experience on multiple projects with X". It covers the 4.9 years case too.

- Degree or equivalent

  Honestly, who cares if you studied or not? Unless it is a strict requirement
  of your project: that happens when you work in specific situations, I had to
  hire a lot of developers with a degree once as I was leading a project for
  the Italian government (yeah we do have some form of "goverment", there's no
  proof it is helpful though) and that was their non-sense requirement. So, in
  short, if you must hire people with a degree please give a proper
  explanation about it in your ad. The only significant difference I found
  while working with people that have a degree is they sometimes start a
  sentence with "I read in this book". Well, I would hardly consider that a
  plus.

- Use of design patterns

  I read this one a lot. What the heck? What do you even mean with this one?
  "If you did not read this book you are not cool"? I really have hard times
  understanding it. I do not think it ever happened to me to say or to hear
  something like "I think we should use the strategy pattern here". It is good
  if you read this book because it is a good (super boring) book. But I can
  hardly justify the requirement in an ad.

Last but not least, I want to underline that it is very likely for candidates
to read about your company for the first time while reading your ad. It is the
first point of contact in most cases and you do not want give people the usual
impression you are just another company out there using the same ad as
everyone else. Even from a very cynical point of view as the conversion rate
of leads into actual new team members you should really care about your ads.

## Screening people

This is harder than it looks like, as with everything else when it comes about
hiring. Sadly here I do not have much to say as the only thing I see happening
often that I do not think it is a good idea is leaving the screening to one
person in your team. If you have more than one team you can play a small game,
you can try to figure out with the teams if people would fit in their team.
There are less chances of getting it wrong and reject someone based on the
fact your team member did not have a good coffee in the morning.  Obviously,
this process may turn to be very expensive and I have had this argument
already. But if you are not willing to spend time about getting people you
probably should not be working with people.

There is one other thing I would like to discuss about screening and, sadly,
this will sound as an annoying rant. But that's how I feel about it and if you
made this so far in this article you must care at least a little.
Code challenges are bullshit and you should stop it altogether. Here we go. I
said it. Now I have to justify my claim somehow but this is a rant remember?
So I will leave raw ideas here and there because I'm actually still too angry
at my own industry and this practise to come up with some calm coesive
argument:

- How many times did you fire someone because of her hard skills?

  I never did, for example. The problem was never the code. I had to fire
  people (which by the way sucks so hard you should work to just not get there
  and hire "the right people") because they misbehaved with co-workers.
  Because they couldn't find their place in their team. Because they didn't
  like us (of course that's fine too, do not take it personal if it happens to
  you). But the problem was never the code and you know why? Because that's
  the easy part of working with a team of developers. Understanding the
  requirements, interacting with other people with a different background,
  culture, skillset, experience. That's the hard part.

- Do you really need a code challenge to understand people's hard skills?

  C'mon. Really? Don't you get the feeling it takes a few simple questions
  about their experiences with different technology to asset their level?
  Beware I'm actually just assuming people use code challenges for this
  reason. I simply cannot understand the reason and maybe I should talk more
  to people using this hiring technique.

- Aren't you afraid of false positive?

  This may sound completely stupid to you (well, that would be fine) but my
  main argument for avoiding code challenges is: I'm afraid people that do not
  like code challenges wouldn't apply for my company. If you think about it,
  you're giving a lot of importance to the "writing the code" part. Is that
  what developers do? Don't you tell yourself all the time you like building
  things? Or solving problems? "writing the code" is just one tool. And, to be
  honest, I believe the more experienced you are the less you try to actually
  solve a problem with code.

As you can imagine, I never used code challenge in my career, I've hired a lot
of people just fine without it. And look, they all knew how to write the code
you care so much about.

## Interviewing people

This is notoriusly hard for everyone. It's hard not to intimidate people at
interviews and for this reason it's easy to miss the right talent for your
company. So you have to make sure you're talking like a human being. You can't
treat people like computers (I do know a lot of people that would prefer that
to be fine). What I suggest is the following: ask about background. Try to
understand who those people you're talking to are. Try to understand if they
are the employee you want them to be. Do not try to match your wishes with
their profile. It never works like that. You know, they're human beings, so
they evolve constantly. They have different needs, they come from different
countries.
Then ask about the past experiences if they have some. And here I may get
technical if needed. I do not ask questions like:

- What's 2^16?
- What are you favourite data structures?
- What version of Ruby do you use?
- What's the difference between ArrayList and Vector?

Two things here: those are all questions people asked me. Believe it or not
there are companies asking such ridicolous questions. Are you really asking
questions like those too? Why? Honest question. Please let me know. Because
it's out of my understanding.

I ask what I call vertical questions about technologies. I'm no native speaker
so maybe "vertical questions" makes no sense for you. This is what I mean:
vertical questions are those kind of questions that are vertical to your
experience level. Your answer will change over the years because your
perception of the topic, your understanding of it will change over the years.
I encourage you to think over this. You will find a lot of technical questions
you can ask that won't sound like the bullshit above-mentioned. And they are
going to be more inclusive questions too: they're not aggressive. They do not
focus on the small details but rather on the actual understanding people have
of this or that technology. Here is a quick list of things I may ask depending
on the context:

- What's your opinion about automated tests?
- Do you care more about a specific way of testing things? (Like unit vs
  integration tests)
- Why/When would you TDD?
- When do you think it's a good idea to rewrite a piece of software?
- What do you like/dislike about technology X?

You see, those questions look easy but I urge you to think about them. Don't
they tell you more than a piece of code about how much the person you have in
front of you knows about what they're talking about?

## Hiring or rejecting people

Please be fast. That is the only thing I can say I have learned. I have been
slow, sometimes I did not even notify people and that is something I am
ashamed about. It is wrong. We need to respect the people that we interview as
much as we can. So being fast is very important and I do fail it when I do not
have a good process in place.
The other aspect I really try hard to be as good as possible is the actual
feedback I share with people: I hate canned answers. So I do tell them things
along the lines of "Sorry I just liked someone else more than you. You were
fine". And I get quite some good feedback about that. And I know why. People
hate when you lie to them in their face without shame.
Please note that I do use canned answers in some cases. And this costed me a
lot of thinking to accept I did need canned answers from time to time. So I
split my answers in two categories:

- If both parts invested time in interviews and meeting (no code challenges
  here!) then I do write personal emails.
- If I know there's not going to be any time investment (like when you reject
  someone upfront because you do not believe in bringing this person to the
  interviews stage) then I use a canned answer. Fast canned answer is better
  than slow "kind of canned answer" when there's no point in moving forward.

Now just a few words about hiring people:

- Be fast, talent goes away fast. Make people an offer, try to get them
  on-board as fast as you can.
- Try to make their first days as cool as possible. Build a process with your
  teams to make it so. Generally, if you already have "the right people"
  they'll be very happy to create a process to ensure quality of the
  on-boarding process.

## Some more few words

A few random thoughts about things that I find very hard but I still try as
hard as I can to achieve:

- Diversity is key for success. Make it obvious in your hiring process.
- Do not fall into the "cultural fit" trap. People do not have to fit "into
  your teams". They have to fit "within your team".
